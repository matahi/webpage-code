	<p><em>Introduction</em> : Epigenetic modifications such as aberrant DNA methylation has long been associated with tumorogenesis. Little is known, however, about how these modifications appear in cancer progres- sion. Comparing the methylome of breast carcinomas and locoregional evolutions could shed light on this process.</p>

<p><em>Methods</em> : The methylome profiles of 48 primary breast carcinomas (PT) and their matched axillary metastases (PT/AM pairs, 20 cases), local recurrences (PT/LR pairs, 17 cases) or contralateral breast carcinomas (PT/CL pairs, 11 cases) were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyzes were performed to determine differentially methylated probes (DMPs), and a similarity score was defined to compare methylation profiles. Correlation with copy-number based score was calculated and metastatic-free sur- vival was compared between methods.</p>

<p><em>Results</em> : 49 DMPs were found for the PT/AM set, but none for the others (FDR &lt; 5%). Hierarchical clustering clustered 75% of the PT/AM, 47% of the PT/LR, and none of the PT/CL pairs together. A methylation-based score (MS) was defined as a clonality measure. The PT/AM set contained a high proportion of clonal pairs while PT/LR pairs were evenly split between high and low MS score, suggesting two groups : true recurrences (TR) and new primary tumors (NP). CL were classified as new tumors. MS score was significantly correlated with copy-number based scores. There was no significant difference between the metastatic-free survival of groups of patients based on different classifications.</p>

<p><em>Conclusion</em> : Epigenomic alterations are well suited to study clonality and track cancer progression. Methylation-based classification of TR and NP performed as well as clinical and copy-number based methods suggesting that these phenomenons are tightly linked.</p>
